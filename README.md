LINX
========

### Interact with the world using LabVIEW to control embedded platforms like Arduino and chipKIT and myRIO.

LINX provides easy to use VIs for interacting with common embedded platforms like Arduino, chipKIT and myRIO. Use the built in sensor VIs to start getting data to your PC in seconds or use the peripheral VIs to access your devices digital I/O, analog I/O, SPI, I2C, UART, PWM and more.

### Supported Devices
LINX works with many devices, but the list of officially supported devices is smaller.
Supported devices: Arduino Uno, Raspberry Pi 2/3/4, BeagleBone Black

There are also a few devices that will NOT work with LINX.
Non-working devices: Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi Zero W
