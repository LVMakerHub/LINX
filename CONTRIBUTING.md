# Contributing to LINX 

Contributions to LINX are welcome from all!

LINX is managed via [git](https://git-scm.com), with the canonical upstream
repository hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/MakerHub/LINX/).

LINX follows a pull-request model for development.  If you wish to
contribute, you will need to create a GitHub account, fork this project, push a
branch with your changes to your project, and then submit a pull request.

Please remember to sign off your commits (e.g., by using `git commit -s` if you
are using the command line client). This amends your git commit message with a line
of the form `Signed-off-by: Name Lastname <name.lastmail@emailaddress.com>`. Please
include all authors of any given commit into the commit message with a
`Signed-off-by` line. This indicates that you have read and signed the Developer
Certificate of Origin (see below) and are able to legally submit your code to
this repository.

See [GitHub's official documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) for more details.
